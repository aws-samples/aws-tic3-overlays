## AWS TIC-3 Overlay examples

The included artifacts are sample overlays for AWS services. 

TIC overlays are intended to align TIC security capabilities, described in the [TIC 3.0 Security
Capabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/tic-guidance) (Security Capabilities Catalog), with available vendor products, services, and
applications.

AWS will continue to update this repo with new overlays and as new AWS services and features are released:

## Current Overlays 

### TIC Service mapping 
  * This [XLS file ](/Overlay-Documents/TIC%20service%20mappingDownloads.xlsx) includes a mapping of TIC-3 Security workbook requirements and PEP controls to AWS services and also overlays them against NIST CSF, NIST 800-53r4 and NIST 800-53r5

### N-Tier 
- [This overlay](/Overlay-Documents/n-tier_Overlay.pdf) demonstrates how TIC security capabilities are achieved in the case of an N-tier (typically a 3-tier) web application.

### Remote VDI
- [This overlay](/Overlay-Documents/Remote_VDI_Overlay.pdf) demonstrates how TIC security capabilities are achieved in the case of a Remote/Virtual Desktop environment.

### Hybrid edge
- [This overlay](/Overlay-Documents/Hybrid_Edge_Overlay.pdf) demonstrates how TIC security capabilities are achieved for Hybrid/Edge computing.

### Container and abstracted services
- [This overlay](/Overlay-Documents/Containers_Abstracted_Overlay.pdf) demonstrates how TIC security capabilities are achieved in the case of a containerized or abstracted (serverless) services.

### Central inspection
- [This overlay](/Overlay-Documents/Centralized-Inspection-Overlay.pdf) demonstrates how TIC security capabilities are achieved for centralized inspection.
